(1) Mine sweeping
- Move the MRV on a chessboard and find which squares have mine on them. Position of the square should be obtained using information from camera.

(2) Using hall effect sensor to capture image
- Magnet will switch off the sensor and this will trigger camera

(4) Use radiation data to adjust camera parameters (exposure, shutter speed etc)

(3) Accurate positioning
- Using speed and time for motion, reach at an accurate position
- Proof of accuracy can be gained by having the MRV take a picture of precisely located object to be at the center of the image with box around the object that must appear sqauare instead of rectangle.

(5) Use to turn on a light on MRV to take a better picture
